// My Secret Team is an interesting story about a little boy who belongs to a family of soccer fans. But unfortunately he secretly supported the Boston Rovers while his family supported the Boston Town team. Being different was difficult. He watched matches with his family and cheered along with the family for the team that he did not support. He expressed his real feelings only when he is alone.
// To celebrate the win he wants to write a computer program which will print “Hello Daffodil Polytechnic Institute!”. Assume that the boy hired you to do this for him. For this you just have to write the following code exactly and just submit.

// #include <stdio.h>
// int main()
// {
//     printf("Hello Daffodil Polytechnic Institute!\n");
//     return 0;
// }
// Input
// There is no input in this problem. Only write the code exactly and submit.

// Output
// Hello Daffodil Polytechnic Institute!





#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("Hello Daffodil Polytechnic Institute!\n");
    return 0;
